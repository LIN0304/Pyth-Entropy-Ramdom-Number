# Pyth Entropy Lottery Agent Protocol

This document summarizes the execution protocol for automated agents interacting with the Pyth Entropy Lottery system. It mirrors the detailed specification provided in the project documentation and includes guidance for initialization, operation, and error handling.

## Initialization Steps
1. Validate network connection and contract deployment.
2. Confirm agent configuration and wallet balance.
3. Ensure Pyth Entropy service availability.
4. Establish contract interfaces and verify addresses.
5. Synchronize state with on-chain data before operations.

## Operational Workflows
- **Lottery Entry Execution**: Validates entry conditions, optimizes gas, and submits transactions with retry logic.
- **Draw Monitoring**: Continuously checks for drawable pools, initiates draws, and handles callbacks.
- **Profit Extraction**: Calculates profits, executes withdrawal strategy, and verifies results.

## Error Resolution
Agents classify errors into network issues, contract reverts, state inconsistencies, gas spikes, and entropy failures. Automated strategies attempt immediate fixes, defer when necessary, and escalate persistent problems.

## Performance Optimization
Gas parameters are tuned using recent price trends. Batch operations are grouped to reduce costs and improve execution efficiency.

## Security Considerations
Transactions undergo security checks for recipient, amount, nonce, gas limit, and call data. Private keys should be stored in an HSM with regular rotation and access controls.

## Monitoring and Reporting
Metrics on transactions, pool participation, system health, and profit are collected continuously. Reports can be generated on hourly, daily, or weekly schedules with alerts for anomalous conditions.

## Configuration Templates
Example conservative and aggressive configurations are provided to tailor agent behavior to different risk tolerances.

## Compliance Statement
This protocol implements the required validation mechanisms and adheres to best practices for interacting with Pyth Entropy. All operations are logged, monitored, and subject to automated compliance verification.
